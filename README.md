# VideoGames
An ETL project using python and SQL 

I am hoping to further develop my SQL and Python skills with this ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project. I am using various video game datasets from kaggle.com. As of 1/25/24, The framework for this project is complete. My Python code for extracting, formatting, cleaning/filtering, and combining the data is complete. The Python code sucessfully can load the data into my SQL tables. My SQL code for creating the tables, editing tables, and conducting simple querrries is complete. 

If I have time in the future, some things I would like to do are: (1) increase the complexitiy of the data transformation/filtering/cleaning. (2) Conduct exploratory data analysis in Python or R. (3) Increase the complexity and interdependence of my SQL table layout. (4) Generate more complex SQL querries and generate interesting results from the data. (5) Export data back out my SQL sever into Python for further analysis
