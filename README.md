An ETL project using python and SQL 

Work in progress 1/12/24

I am hoping to further develop my SQL and Python skills with this ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project. I am using various video game datasets from kaggle.com. 

(30% complete) Extract
(30% complete) Tramsform
(100% complete) Load - Python Functions for inputting data into SQL are working
(0% complete) SQL Querries for further analysis and data exploration
